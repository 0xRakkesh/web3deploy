**w3deploy** is a developer tool (CLI + backend) that lets you deploy static websites to a global CDN with a single command. It's similar to Vercel or Netlify, but open-source and self-hostable. It supports everything from a plain `index.html` file to complex React, Vue, and Next.js applications.

---

## Features

- **⚡️ One-Command Deploy:** Push your site to a global CDN in seconds.
- **🌐 Framework Agnostic:** Supports React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Astro, and plain HTML.
- **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Seamless GitHub OAuth integration.
- **🏠 Self-Hostable:** Run your own backend using Cloudflare Workers and AWS S3.
- **🚀 Edge Caching:** Assets are cached at the edge for blazing fast load times globally.

## Supported Frameworks

w3deploy works with any framework that produces a static output directory. The routing engine is smart enough to handle all of them automatically:

| Framework | Output Dir | Routing Mode |
|---|---|---|
| React (Vite) | `dist` | SPA (falls back to `index.html`) |
| React (CRA) | `build` | SPA (falls back to `index.html`) |
| Vue | `dist` | SPA (falls back to `index.html`) |
| Svelte | `build` | SPA (falls back to `index.html`) |
| Next.js (`output: 'export'`) | `out` | SSG (`/about` → `/about/index.html`) |
| Astro | `dist` | SSG (`/about` → `/about/index.html`) |
| Gatsby | `public` | SSG (`/about` → `/about/index.html`) |
| Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | `.` or `dist` | HTML (`/about` → `/about.html`) |
